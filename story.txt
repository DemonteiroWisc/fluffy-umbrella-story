A man named Bob jumped into Lake Mendota in the middle of December. Bob was
not the smartest man alive, he did not always make the best decisions.
Luckily for Bob, his friend was there and pulled him out of the lake. They then went into Memoiral Union and got hot chocolate.
After talking for a bit, they decided to go to State Street. They didn't really know what they were going to do, but decided to just go with the flow.
However, he soon changed his mind. He went home sleeping since he hasn't sleeped for three days because he worked hard on Red-Black Tree programming assignment.
Poor Bob  :(  
But, when he woke up the next day, he was a new man. Life ended up being good for Bob.
